# x11-thorium-browser
This project provides a simple solution for deploying and streaming a Thorium-browser session in kiosk mode via VNC. It sets up a virtual X11 display using Xvfb, streams the display using x11vnc, and ensures compatibility with headless Linux environments. Ideal for showcasing web content in fullscreen remotely.
